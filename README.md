This is my portfolio website. Its build React and React Three Fiber. The 3D model is build in Blender, while I sued Inkscape for the graphics. For further improvement Im thinking about implementing Firebase in the future (for the projects/details). Also an updated and even more exciting 3D scene is already in the works.
