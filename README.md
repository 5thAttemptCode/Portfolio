# Portfolio  

www.henry-dev.com  

This is my portfolio website. It's build with React and React Three Fiber, the 3D model is build in Blender, while I used Inkscape for the graphics.
I had two requirements to myself when building this project:  

#1: The 3D scene had to be unique, no cookie cutter Three JS, and the 3D model had to be interactive - I want the user to interact with the model to get all the information provided. I refused to create a scene where the 3D model just floats somewhere in the background, without adding any real value to the project.  

#2: Making it responsive had to be easy. I have seen a lot of Three JS projects which weren't responsive at all, or which didnt work properly on smaller screen sizes.  

I worked approximately 10 weeks to this project, spanning from the initial ideation phase to its eventual launch. The most time-consuming aspect was aligning the graphic elements with the 3D model to achieve the envisioned result in the browser. Another challenge I encountered was the animation of the camera. Here React-Spring came in very handy. A UX designer might complain that UX is not the greatest on my website, however Three JS is known for throwing the handbook of traditional UI/UX away and do its own thing.
